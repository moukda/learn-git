   <h1>Ukraine war: Kyiv counts cost of fragile independence</h1>
   <img src="images/b.webp" alt="Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko" height="400" style="border: 5px solid #2f2; border-radius: 12px;">
   <p> 
    <b>
        Few know the cost of challenging Russian influence better
    </b><strong>than Viktor Yushchenko.</strong>
    <br>
    The former Ukrainian president was poisoned with a toxic chemical while campaigning in 2004 against a Moscow-preferred candidate. He then led protests against a rigged election before taking office the following year.
    <br>
    Sitting in his timber-framed home on the outskirts of Kyiv, Mr Yushchenko praises the "power of national spirit" as the key to Ukraine's independence.
    <hr>
    "Today I can say with confidence that 42 million Ukrainians speak in one voice. And that allows us to face any enemy, including Russia."
    <i>You can still see the scarring on the former president's face from when he was poisoned. |</i>
    <em>Ukraine's day of independence falls six months to the day since Vladimir Putin launched an invasion from the north, east and south. In that time, almost 9,000 members of the Ukrainian military have been killed and some 5,500 civilian deaths have been confirmed by the UN.</em>
    <br><br>
    <small>While few here predicted the war, Mr Yushchenko <sup>largely blame</sup> <sub> what he sees</sub> as the West's historic inability to combat Russian aggression: notably the <ins>2008</ins> conflict in Georgia and the annexation of Crimea <del>six years later.</del></small>
    <mark>However,</mark> he thinks Ukraine's ultimate test has changed its standing in the world.
